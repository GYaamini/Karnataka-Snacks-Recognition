## About The Project

Food being an inseparable part of human's life, it is difficult for people to recognize and to find the recipe of traditional snacks descended by their ancestors. In this project, a food recognition system is implemented with 12 snacks originated in Karnataka where each snack has challenges like inter-class similarities, intra-class dissimilarities, diverse background, noise, and etc. The project is carried out using ResNet50 transfer learning technique.
To demonstrate the project, an android mobile application is developed which recognises the snack and gives recipe in Kannada and in English.

## Usage

### Install the ನನ್ನ ತಿಂಡಿ.apk (Nanna Tindi) and input an image

![SnackRecognition and Recipe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ee9eb50-82ea-4d57-ac64-7319b8a415cf)

### if the snack is recognised, the recognition and the recipe is presented as:

![Snack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca81e82c-7694-485c-bc4e-4a388e28e24f)

### if not, the result screen would be:

![NotASnack](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/310ab2b2-205a-481e-b22e-f0e08cb9e08a)
