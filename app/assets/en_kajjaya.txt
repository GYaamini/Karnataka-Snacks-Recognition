KAJJAYA

Ingredients:
1 cup rice
1 tsp sesame seeds / til
1 tsp poppy seeds / khuskhus
¾ cup jaggery
¼ cup water
¼ tsp cardamom powder
½ tsp pepper (crushed)
oil / ghee for deep frying

Instructions:
Grease the butter paper with oil and pinch a small ball sized dough. Pat and flatten to form a slightly thick disk. Peel the kajjaya gently, without breaking apart. Now deep fry in medium hot oil or ghee. Fry on medium flame until the bottom part is cooked well. Keep splashing oil on top to cook evenly. Now gently, turn over the kajjaya, and fry on both sides. Fry until both the sides turn golden and slightly crisp. Do not fry too much, as the kajjaya will burn and turn black. Slightly press the kajjaya to remove of excess oil. Finally, enjoy kajjaya for 2 weeks by storing in an airtight container.
