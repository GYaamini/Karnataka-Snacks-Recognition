MYSORE PAK

Ingredients:
2 cup sugar
1 pinch baking soda
1 cup gram flour (besan)
2 cup ghee
1/2 cup water

Instructions:
Add 1 cup of ghee to a pan and heat it over medium flame. Once the ghee is sufficiently hot, add gram flour in it and roast it for a few minutes. Make sure that you roast the gram flour properly so that the raw smell goes away. In another pan, boil the sugar with water till it reaches one string consistency. When the sugar syrup is prepared, add the fried gram flour in it and stir well till it thickens. Heat the remaining ghee and gently add the gram flour mixture. Keep stirring continuously so that no lumps are formed. When the ghee starts to rise up from the sides and begins to separate, add the cooking soda. Stir and pour into a greased plate. Gently spread the mixture and allow it to cool. Before it hardens fully, slice into desired shapes. Store in an airtight container and serve as you like.
